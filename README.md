This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Use Node.js 22.22.1 or newer and npm 11.9.0. With `nvm`, select the
repository-pinned runtime before installing dependencies:

```bash
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page
auto-updates as you edit the file.

The application uses a system font stack, so development and production builds
do not download fonts from an external service.

Next.js is temporarily pinned to the exact `16.3.0-canary.105` pre-release.
That release is the first available version whose declared PostCSS and sharp
dependencies remove the known high-severity production advisories affecting
the stable release. Replace this pin with the first compatible patched stable
Next.js release after verifying the build, tests, and production audit.
